# Student Performance Prediction

## Overview  
This project builds machine learning models to predict students' academic performance based on various demographic, social, and academic factors. The goal is to help educators identify students who may need additional support early on.

## Features  
- Uses multiple ML algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees  
- Performs data preprocessing and feature selection to improve model accuracy  
- Compares model performance using metrics such as R² score and Mean Squared Error  
- Identifies key factors impacting student performance for actionable insights

## Dataset  
The dataset includes student demographics, past academic records, and behavioral information. (You can link your dataset or mention the [UCI Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance))

## Results

- Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved over **90% R² score** on the test dataset.
- Feature importance analysis identified key predictors such as **attendance**, **study time**, and **parental education**.
- The model can help educators identify at-risk students early to provide targeted support.
